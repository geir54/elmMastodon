elmMastodon
====

A web app for [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) implemented in [Elmlang](http://elm-lang.org). I did this to learn Elm so the app/code is not perfect, but it does work.

### How to run
I inculded a compiled html file if you want to test it without installing Elm. So to try it simple clone the repo and open index.html in your browser.
